# I build delightful, user-friendly websites that help small businesses show off their awesome work.

Hello there! I’m Karla, a freelance web designer + developer based out of Beaverton, OR. My passion for tech and design (as well as my need to fix all the issues I ran into while surfing the web) is what inspired me to become a web developer (call me Karla the (web) Builder. Can we fix it? YES WE CAN!). That means all the websites I build are accessible, responsive, easy to navigate and all about your brand.

I understand what it’s like to start your own business and navigate that stressful journey, so I’m here as a friend cheering you on while bringing your web presence to life.

When I’m not building sites, you can find me doodling on my iPad, playing video games with my husband, or eating a churro at Disneyland.
