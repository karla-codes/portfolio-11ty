  Hi! My name is Karla and I'm a web developer based out of Portland, OR. I enjoy making things,
  especially within the digital realm, so I was excited when I discovered web development. Building
  websites gives me the opportunity to help people all over the world while getting to be creative
  (win, win!). This inspired me to make the switch to a career in tech, bringing along the skills I
  learned while working in retail/customer service. I quickly fell in love with building delightful,
  user-friendly, and accessible web experiences.

  experience and I can't wait to be part of a team where I can help bring thoughtful web experiences
  to life.
