about:
  [
    "Most of my work experience revolves around retail and customer service but my love for learning, creativity and helping others helped me discover the wonderful world of web development. I've been self-learning for the past few years and I remember the moment I was hooked: my first ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô. Refreshing the browser and seeing the code that I wrote come to life felt like magic! The internet allows us to connect with people all over the world and building products that will impact so many people is not only mind-blowing ü§Ø  but it also motivates me to create products that focus on being inclusive and intuitive.",
    "I love CSS and I'm also very interested in animation and building fun, interactive things with code. In my pursuit to understand JavaScript better, I recently graduated from the Treehouse Full-Stack JS Techdegree, allowing me to expand my skillset and understanding of the web.",
    " I'm currently looking for my first job in tech where I can work as part of a team of like-minded individuals who truly care about the user experience. Writing code and building digital products is a challenging but super rewarding experience and I can't wait to be part of a team where I can help bring thoughtful web experiences to life. ",
    "When I‚Äôm not building sites, you can find me doodling on my iPad, playing video games with my husband, or eating a churro at Disneyland.",
